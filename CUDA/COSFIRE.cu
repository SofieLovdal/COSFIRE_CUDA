/*
* CUDA kernel for effective implementation of the COSFIRE algorithm.
* 
* Takes a preprocessed input image and a set of tuples as input (preprocessing
* of image and configuration of filter is done in Matlab).
* The kernel performs the following steps in parallel:
* 
* 1. Generates DoG filters corresponding to each unique sigma
* and convolves this with the input image
* 
* 2. Generates Gaussian blur filter for each unique (sigma, rho)-combination
* in the set of tuples and performs dilation (max-blurring) on each corresponding
* response from (1.)
* 
* 3.Output the response image by weighted geometric mean after shifting 
* each subresponse according to (rho, theta).
* 
* Sofie Lovdal 5.6.2018
* 
* For now, the implementation allocates the necessary big chunks of 
* memory on host side and passes it to the algorithm governing kernel.
